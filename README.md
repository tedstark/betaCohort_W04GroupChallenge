GCU Java Programming Bootcamp, Day 20

//The Fruit Market<br>
//For this challenge, you will be working with 4 commodities; Apples, Oranges, Bananas, and Grapes. Delicious, right?<br>
//When the application loads, you will need to have information for each of the commodities,<br>
//  specifically the name and the market price of each. This information will need to be displayed<br>
//  in a meaningful way on the visual application using.<br>
//Every 15 seconds, the prices should change however, and with it, the listed price on the display.<br>
//Specifically, the market price of each of the items should fluctuate up or down 50 cents<br>
//  (between 1 cent and 50 cents) with each 15 second interval.<br>
//Any given fruit is not allowed to go below a cost of 50 cents, or above the cost of 9 dollars and 99 cents.<br>
//The information displayed for each of the fruit should have a button-like functionality where the user<br>
//  can interact with each of the fruit displays. Available to the user is a total cash and an inventory<br>
//  display that shows how much of each of the fruits they have purchased.<br>
//Create a way for players to sell their fruit inventory at whatever the current market price of that fruit it.<br>
//Deduct from their inventory and add to their total cash.<br>
//The user is not allowed to spend more than they have. The user will start with $100.<br>
//
//Next Steps:<br>
//Also in the user display, should be an average purchased price, which shows, on average,<br>
//  how much money they have spent on a given fruit in their inventory. Meaning that by clicking on the<br>
// display for each of the fruits, allows the user to buy one of the fruits, at market price,<br>
// which will be deducted from the total cash.<br>
